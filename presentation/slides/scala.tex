\begin{frame}{Scala}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Invented in 2004 at EPFL
    \item Runs on the JVM
    \item Statically typed, multi-paradigm and versatile
    \item Focus on type safety and expressiveness
    \item Complete revamp of the language in version 3
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Scala was invented 20 years ago at EPFL, in Lausanne, while trying to address some of the limitations of Java. It runs on the JVM
        \item It is statically typed with inference, and is designed to be a general purpose language
        \item It has a powerful type system compared to other programming languages, which happens to also be Turing-complete as we will see later
        \item To be noted that the language has been recently rewritten from ground-up, enabling some of the metaprogramming features natively
    \end{itemize}
